# Integrate-and-Fire-Neurons

This project models simple leaky integrate and fire neurons, and will eventually model neurons from the higher visual areas in order to understand their synaptic dynamics and the nature of their inhibition/excitation patterns. 
Currently modeling the temporal frequency dynamics outlined in Chance, Nelson & Abbott (1998) "Synaptic Depression and the Temporal Response Characteristics of V1 Cells"
